## Entware-ng-3x

This is a fork of Entware-3g project: https://github.com/Entware-ng/Entware-ng

The main differences from the original project are
- 3.x kernels are used to build toolchain. 3.4.112 is used for mipsel and 3.2.40 is used for arm and intel;
- glibc is now a system library for all architectures including mipsel;
- glibc has a pathch that allows to use separate (from the original firmware) users and passwords;
- two different installations are possible for most devices: (1) standard, (2) alternative (with serarated from firmware users).
